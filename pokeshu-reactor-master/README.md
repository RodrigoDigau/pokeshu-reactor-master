# pokeshuapi-reactor
A non-blocking, reactive API client for [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) with caching for Spring Boot projects.
this is an version of pokeApi-reactor.

### Features
* Non-blocking HTTP operations and non-blocking caching.
* Fully customizable caching. Supports Spring Boot's generic [CacheManager](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.3.0.M1/reference/html/boot-features-caching.html#_supported_cache_providers) for caching.
* Caching and non-caching configurations.

## Getting started
### Project Configuration

#### Properties
You can (must) configure the location of the PokeAPI instance you want to use. Add the following property to your `application.properties`:

```
pokeshu.api.base-uri=https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/ #or the url of your own instance
```

#### Application Context
Import one of pokeapi-reactor's configurations as well as specify your own [reactor.netty.http.client.HttpClient](https://projectreactor.io/docs/netty/release/api/reactor/netty/http/client/HttpClient.html) bean. Two configurations are available: caching and non-caching. Below is an example of a caching configuration.

```java
@Configuration
@Import(PokeApiReactorCachingConfiguration.class)
@EnableCaching
public class MyPokeApiReactorCachingConfiguration {
	@Bean
	public HttpClient httpClient() {
		return HttpClient.create()
                  .compress(true)
                  .resolver(DefaultAddressResolverGroup.INSTANCE);
	}
}
```
Or, if you'd rather not enable caching:
```java
@Configuration
@Import(Pokeshu.ApiReactorNonCachingConfiguration.class)
public class MyPokeApiReactorNonCachingConfiguration {
   @Bean
	public HttpClient httpClient() { ... }
}
```
Both the `PokeshuApiReactorCachingConfiguration` and `PokeshuApiReactorNonCachingConfiguration` will register the appropriate `PokeshuApiClient` bean.

### Fetching a resource
Inject the registered `PokeshuApiClient` into your class and request a resource.
```java
@Autowired
private PokeshuApiClient pokeshuApiClient;

...

public void printPokemon() {
   pokeApiClient.getResource(Pokemon.class, "pikachu")
      .map(pokemon -> String.format("%s has %d forms", pokemon.getName(), pokemon.getForms().size()))
      .subscribe(System.out::println);
}
```
If you don't mind blocking, you can simply block for the resource.
```java
public void printPokemon() {
   Pokemon pokemon = pokeApiClient.getResource(Pokemon.class, "pikachu").block();
   String pokemonInfo = String.format("%s has %d forms", pokemon.getName(), pokemon.getForms().size()));
   System.out.println(pokemonInfo);
}
```

### Following a resource
Following links to other resources also has first-class support.

```java
public void printPokemonForms() {
   pokeApiClient.getResource(Pokemon.class, "pikachu")
      .flatMapMany(pokemon -> pokeApiClient.followResources(pokemon::getForms, PokemonForm.class))
      .map(form -> String.format("Pikachu has a form called %s", form.getName()))
      .subscribe(System.out::println);
}
```
Again, with blocking:
```java
public void printPokemonForms() {
   Pokemon pokemon = pokeApiClient.getResource(Pokemon.class, "pikachu").block();
   List<PokemonForm> forms = pokeApiClient.followResources(pokemon::getForms, PokemonForm.class)
      .collectList()
      .block();

   for(PokemonForm form : forms) {
      String formInfo = String.format("Pikachu has a form called %s", form.getName());
      System.out.println(formInfo);
   }
}
```

### Maven Configuration
The latest release can be pulled from GitHub's Apache Maven repository. To pull from their repository, you must add your GitHub credentials to your [settings.xml](https://maven.apache.org/settings.html) (located in `${user.home}/.m2/settings.xml`). You can read [GitHub's artical about how to do that](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-apache-maven-registry). But for impatient programmer's, below is yet another guide to configure Maven to pull from GitHub that holds your hand a little more closely - I always appreciate it when people do that.


#### Generate a token
[Generate a PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) (Personal Access Token) with the `read:packages` privilege.

#### Add \<server\> and \<repository\> tags in settings.xml 
Configure Maven to [authenticate when trying to pull from GitHub's Apache Maven repoistory](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-apache-maven-registry#authenticating-with-a-personal-access-token). If you don't have a settings.xml, create it under your .m2 directory. It should look something like this.

```xml
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0
                      http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">

  <activeProfiles>
    <activeProfile>github</activeProfile>
  </activeProfiles>

  <profiles>
    <profile>
      <id>github</id>
      <repositories>
        <repository>
          <id>central</id>
          <url>https://repo1.maven.org/maven2</url>
        </repository>        
       </profile>
  </profiles>
  <servers>
    <server>
      <username>YOUR USERNAME</username>
      <password>YOUR TOKEN YOU JUST CREATED</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>
```
